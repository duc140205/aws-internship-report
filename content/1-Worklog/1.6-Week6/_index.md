### Week 6 Objectives:

* Continue getting familiar with the internship environment and AWS learning tools.  
* Start the **AWS Fundamentals** specialization on Coursera to strengthen foundational knowledge.  
* Learn how to draw AWS architectures with draw.io and study sample architectures (RAG Chatbot, AI Agents) from AWS official guidance.  
* Build the project's **first architecture version** using the **Amazon Q CLI** to prepare for hands-on deployment.
