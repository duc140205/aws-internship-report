### Week 5 Objectives:

* Understand foundational database concepts and the difference between **OLTP** and **OLAP**.  
* Learn and practice AWS database services: **Amazon RDS**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Amazon ElastiCache**.  
* Strengthen and advance **SQL** skills from basic to advanced.  
* Learn how to deploy, manage, and optimize database services on AWS.
