### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The First Cloud Journey program provided an excellent learning environment that perfectly balances structure and flexibility. The comprehensive curriculum spanning 12 weeks allowed me to progress systematically from AWS fundamentals to deploying production-ready solutions. The weekly worklog structure helped me stay organized and track my progress effectively. The environment encouraged self-learning while providing adequate resources and support when needed.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team**  
The mentorship and team collaboration throughout the program were outstanding. The team was always available to discuss technical challenges, review my proposals, and guide me through complex AWS concepts. I particularly appreciated how mentors encouraged me to research and propose solutions independently before providing guidance.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The program content was highly relevant to modern cloud computing and software engineering practices. Starting from networking fundamentals (VPC, Security Groups) and progressing to serverless architectures, databases, security, and AI/ML services provided a complete cloud engineering skillset. The hands-on project—building an AI-powered chatbot with admin dashboard—gave me practical experience that directly applies to real-world scenarios. The emphasis on Infrastructure as Code (CDK) and DevOps practices aligns perfectly with current industry standards.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The 12-week journey offered exceptional learning opportunities across multiple dimensions:
- **Technical Skills:** Gained hands-on experience with 10+ AWS services, CDK, serverless computing, database management, and security best practices
- **Architecture Design:** Learned to design scalable, cost-effective cloud solutions using draw.io and Q Developer CLI
- **Documentation:** Improved technical writing through weekly worklogs and translating 3 AWS blog posts
- **Problem-Solving:** Developed debugging skills by resolving Lambda VPC conflicts, timeout issues, and checksum optimization
- **Cost Optimization:** Learned to make architecture decisions based on cost-benefit analysis (S3 archiving strategies)

The progression from theory (Weeks 1-3) → security & databases (Weeks 4-5) → architecture design (Weeks 6-9) → full deployment (Weeks 10-12) was well-paced and logical.

**5. Program Culture & Team Spirit**  
The FCJ program fostered a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation. Team meetings were constructive, with open discussions about technical trade-offs and architecture decisions. The "Data Science on AWS" workshop in Week 6 and other learning events created opportunities to expand knowledge beyond the core curriculum. The team celebrated achievements (completing the midterm, finalizing the proposal, successful deployments) while maintaining a growth mindset. Everyone was willing to share knowledge through Notion documentation and help troubleshoot issues.

**6. Program Policies / Support**  
The program structure was well-designed with clear weekly objectives, comprehensive reference materials (AWS Study Group, Cloud Journey, official AWS docs), and practical labs. The flexibility to explore different approaches (testing File Storage Gateway, FSx, multiple database options) while maintaining focus on the main project was valuable. Access to AWS Free Tier accounts and guidance on budget management helped learn cost optimization from day one.

### Detailed Feedback on Program Phases

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): AWS Fundamentals & Core Services**
- **Strengths:** Comprehensive coverage of IAM, networking, compute, and storage. Hands-on labs reinforced theoretical knowledge.
  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5): Security, Identity & Databases**
- **Strengths:** Excellent progression into advanced IAM concepts, KMS encryption, and database fundamentals. Translation exercises improved technical English.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 6-9): Architecture Design & Project Planning**
- **Strengths:** Learning architecture design tools (draw.io, Q Developer CLI) and studying AWS Solutions Library architectures provided practical context. The midterm exam validated knowledge comprehensively.

**Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12): Full-Stack Deployment & Infrastructure as Code**
- **Strengths:** Hands-on CDK deployment experience was invaluable. Iterative refinement through multiple deployments taught real DevOps practices.
