In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, containers have become the cornerstone of modern application deployment. As businesses increasingly adopt microservices architectures, the demand for robust, scalable, and secure container management solutions has never been higher. We’re thrilled to announce that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been recognized as a Leader in the 2024-25 Omdia Universe for Cloud Container Management & Services, which evaluates top vendors providing container management solutions hosted on public clouds. AWS has been named a Leader in this report, ranking first on the Capability axis and second on the Strategy & Execution / Customer Experience axis.

Omdia Universe reports are globally recognized as a valuable source of technology analysis and vendor rankings. These reports help technology buyers make informed decisions by providing insights into vendors, products, and services, and identifying leaders, challengers, and prospects in specific technology areas. AWS has the broadest and deepest capabilities making it easier to deploy, orchestrate, operate, and monitor containers while offloading many infrastructure management tasks and enabling teams to focus on innovation. AWS provides managed container orchestration with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), which is designed for simplicity and provides an AWS-opinionated solution for running containers at scale, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), the most secure, reliable, managed Kubernetes service which offers Karpenter support for cost optimization.

## Key highlights from the report:
mdia defines an enterprise container management solution as one that is more than just providing a Kubernetes runtime. It encompasses a comprehensive suite of tools and services that enable developers and operations teams to efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. This includes user-friendly control panels, service mesh capabilities, advanced security features, networking solutions, role-based access control, and support for stateful applications.

According to Omdia, “AWS recognizes the business value of container adoption, seeing it as a way to facilitate an innovation flywheel. Automating code delivery and operations encourages agility through more frequent updates and lower failure rates. Especially with containerized microservices, development teams can be smaller and more independent. AWS is geared toward running secure, reliable, and scalable apps and offers a complete DevOps workflow experience and a choice of tools for developers.”

AWS’ recognition as a Leader in this report underscores our commitment to providing best-in-class container services. The report highlights the following strengths for AWS:

- **Broad Choice:** AWS offers a wide range of options for working with Kubernetes or AWS native container management service across cloud, edge, and on-premises environments.
- **Serverless Orchestration:** Customers can choose serverless compute modes, based on their in-house skills and application needs to augment their container management.
- **Resource Optimization:** AWS Karpenter helps optimize cluster resources and reduce costs, maximizing the efficiency of your container deployments.
